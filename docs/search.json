    "text": "Abstract: As the popularity of Japanese production increases worldwide, more fanatics like ourselves that over analyze their statistics grows. The three of us have a deep interest in Japanese animation as a whole and are interested in how the industry would develop. Anime is mainly Japanese animation, although recently China, Korea, and America have contributed to the industry in the past decade. Anime can either be original masterpieces or adaptations from different source materials; for instance: manga, light novel, visual novel, novel, game, book, 4-koma manga (online), etc. In other words there is a substantial amount of source material that can potentially be adapted into a anime by any studio. Due to the increase of popularity in the anime industry worldwide, studios must first ask themselves what type of product would sell in the market."

    "text": "To be weird, strange; unknown to the masses, unrecognizable to most individuals, could actually be a pretty good place to be. —You won’t have many chances to fail in the eyes of those you admire, and you’ll feel security with a small familiar surrounding. —The downside is, that you’ll never truly meet many people who could have made a difference, all because neither of you took the first step closer.\nMost people have yet to sonder. Realize that everyone else has a life as vivid and complex as their own. So they become uninterested or unmotivated in getting to know an uncommon sight. —We wonder about the thoughts of people we do not know, we weigh differences without waiting or watching, ask what we truly want? —We are strange we sit on the sidelines simply pondering but not seeing ahead. Who isn’t uncommon nowadays?\nWhen we were babies the world was painted, filled with color, as we grew, we were taught to paint a silhouette to all we didn’t know, to all we didn’t trust, this went on until we became a reflection of our own shadows, lost within our now black canvas, so from there we started a new. We didn’t know who we were, we were strangers to ourselves, we didn’t try to define, we usually left it for someone else to decide. We’ve since learned and have become someone we are proud to be, we look in the mirror and see the truth of our beings, now that we’re free. Look to everyone around, past pains have always been our common ground! Reach out to another and you will see that strangers are worth it, just like you and me.\n\nRandom Poem\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\nHide\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDifferent Links\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nLink\n\n\nJapanese Hiragana/Kanji\nVocab and practice phrases I formatted in a way to help me study.\nHiragana / Kanji\n\n\nJapanese Katakana\nVocab I formatted in a way to help me study.\nKatakana"

    "title": "Exploratory: ‘Best’ Video Game",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When it comes to hobbies, few would rank above video games. The synergistic mix of audio and visual design give it the most amount of versatility. From casual single screen puzzle games to open world, story rich experiences that give the player freedom to decide how they’d like to enjoy it. The data I’m working with is titled  Video Game Sales  from Gregory Smith in kaggle, it compiles sales data from more than 16,500 games.\nWith it I will attempt to answer a couple of questions:  What is the best video game? Dependent on console? Dependent on genre?\nThere are many different ways to classify a game as ‘good’ many of which are not included in the data, this isn’t going to be a commentary of the quality of these games, just their commercial success. Several of these titles were sold multiple consoles, their sales would the total between them.\n\ndataVG &lt;- read_csv(\"vgsales.csv\")\ndataPlatformFreq &lt;- dataVG %&gt;% \n  select(Name, Platform, Genre, Global_Sales)\n\ndataPlatformFreq &lt;- mutate(dataPlatformFreq,\"Platform_Frequency\" = \n                        ave(seq(nrow(dataVG)), Platform, FUN = length)) %&gt;% \n                        group_by(Platform)\n\nAfter cleaning the data a bit we could compile the unique values under “Platform” to show how many games are in the data with respect to their platform. We could also calculate the total (millions) of sales those games had. Realistically since I’m simplifying my goal to find the ‘best’ I’ shouldn’t limit myself to the various regions the data provides, such that I’m not taking into consideration the most sold in the individual regions the data has (North America, European Union, Japan), Global Sales are the most important to me in this exploratory analysis.\n\n\n   Platform ...Total_Games ...Total_Global_Sales\n1        DS           2163                822.49\n2       PS2           2161               1255.64\n3       PS3           1329                957.84\n4       Wii           1325                926.71\n5      X360           1265                979.96\n6       PSP           1213                296.28\n7        PS           1196                730.66\n8        PC            960                258.82\n9        XB            824                258.26\n10      GBA            822                318.50\n11       GC            556                199.36\n12      3DS            509                247.46\n13      PSV            413                 61.93\n14      PS4            336                278.10\n15      N64            319                218.88\n16     SNES            239                200.05\n17     XOne            213                141.06\n18      SAT            173                 33.59\n19     WiiU            143                 81.86\n20     2600            133                 97.08\n21       GB             98                255.45\n22      NES             98                251.07\n23       DC             52                 15.97\n24      GEN             27                 28.36\n25       NG             12                  1.44\n26      SCD              6                  1.87\n27       WS              6                  1.42\n28      3DO              3                  0.10\n29     TG16              2                  0.16\n30       GG              1                  0.04\n31     PCFX              1                  0.03\n\n\nAbove, I thought it necessary for clarity to see the data in descending order with respect to the total amount of titles per console in the data set. As you would notice, there is a large difference between the quantity of titles the consoles have. To mediate this graphically I separated the data into three sections, above 250, below 250 but above 25, and below 25 games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to include the Genre ‘amount’ in the graphs above to get a general idea of which categories are more prominent for each console. Genre’s would have a dedicated graph later on.\nLets now get what we would call the “best” game with respect to consoles:  Many of these titles are exactly what you’d expect, Super Mario Bros  for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Pacma for the Atari 2600. Although there are some notable titles I wasn’t expecting to find like Minecraft selling 2.25 million copies for the Playstation Vita (PSV).\n\n\n                                     Name ...Platform ...Global Sales\n1                                 Pac-Man        2600            7.81\n2                             Policenauts         3DO            0.06\n3                     Pokemon X/Pokemon Y         3DS           14.35\n4                         Sonic Adventure          DC            2.42\n5                   New Super Mario Bros.

I would have considered the shooter category to go to one of the  Call of Duty  titles but I suppose that was my recency bias. Duck Hunt ends up being the most sold game for the “shooter” genre with 28.31 million copies sold globally.\n\n\n                                 Name     ...Genre ...Global Sales\n1                  Grand Theft Auto V       Action           21.40\n2  Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins    Adventure           11.18\n3             Super Smash Bros.
