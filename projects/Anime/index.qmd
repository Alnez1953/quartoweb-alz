*Abstract:* As the popularity of Japanese production increases worldwide, more fanatics like ourselves that
over analyze their statistics grows. The three of us have a deep interest in Japanese animation as a
whole and are interested in how the industry would develop. Anime is mainly Japanese animation,
although recently China, Korea, and America have contributed to the industry in the past decade.
Anime can either be original masterpieces or adaptations from different source materials; for instance:
manga, light novel, visual novel, novel, game, book, 4-koma manga (online), etc. In other words there
is a substantial amount of source material that can potentially be adapted into a anime by any studio.
Due to the increase of popularity in the anime industry worldwide, studios must first ask themselves
what type of product would sell in the market.
